WHAT THE HECK???!?!?!?!?

https://undici.nodejs.org/#/docs/api/ProxyAgent?id=example-basic-proxy-request-with-global-agent-dispatcher

## Getting Started:

- Clone the repo
- Install dependencies with `yarn`

- Run `node ./target.mjs` and `node ./proxy.mjs`

Then run `node ./index.mjs` and it should use the proxy, but it doesn't!
